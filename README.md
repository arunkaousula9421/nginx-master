# nginx-master
In this Nginx, I guide you through the core concepts of nginx. Then we build a Node.js webserver and set up dockerized instances. We then configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to load balance traffic to those backend servers and finally we configure a secure HTTPS connection to the Nginx proxy with a self-signed TLS certificate.
